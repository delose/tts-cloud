## Practices to add
- SOLID Principles
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## But seriously
- It is better to define these complicated-sounding terminologies one by one in detail

## More seriously though
- It would be better to have a free flow discussion on it, without caring much about the any language specific syntax, so as long as it will be easier to grasp the concepts
