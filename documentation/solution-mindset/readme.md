# Solution-based approach
- This document explains how we should approach a problem and use the below principles as guidelines or tips

## Autonomy mindset
- a developer/team should be able to plan, refine, desgin, and deliver a feature end-to-end without the oversight from a certain authority.
- There must be no "core" person/group/team to which specialist or interesting work is consistently assigned.
- a mix of skills and confidence to take on any aspect of work is needed for a developer to make decisions and progress on his/her own
- There is no expectation that a developer/team has all the information to make the best decisions; they can seek feedback and source the of opinion of specialists and domain experts in the community.

## Discovery
- team must create an Event Storming diagram to capture discovery activites in the problem space
- a problem space diagram captures the refined understanding of the business problem following event storming
- a solution space flow diagram, capturing the planned service interactions to implement a solution to the business problem

## Design Philisophy
- list of design terminologies we can look up on the internet

### Customer-Centric

### Domain-Driven

### Enterprise Context Aware

### Loosely Coupled

### Separation of Concerns

### Exclusive of Extrinsic Data

## Configuration and Rules-Driven
- another list of terminologies

### Flexible and Dynamic

### Transparent and Instrumented

### Iterative Complexity
- take an approach of introducing complexity iteratively
- close partnership with business analyst / product owner may be required

### Technical Debt
- This happens when there is a solution that was created to have a weaker effectivity. Future developments will render the previous "weaker" solutions to be deprecated resulting in the creation of a more robust solution. The gap between the "weaker" and the "stronger" solution is the technocal debt which should always be documented for each iteration of the software.
